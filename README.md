# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Visualiser


This project contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science for both myself and others who are interested.

## Features

- **Data Structures**:
    - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Binary Trees
    - Hash Tables

- **Algorithms**:
    - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
    - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS)
    - Dynamic Programming Examples

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
     ```
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
     ```
     g++ DataStructuresAndAlgorithms.cpp -o DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
     ```
4. Run the executable:
     ```
     ./DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
     ```

## Requirements

- TBD

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the code or add new features as this isn't a finalised project and I will be working more on this as well as other projects at a later date.
